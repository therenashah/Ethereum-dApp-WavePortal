# Ethereum-dApp-WavePortal
A website that lets anyone wave at me after connecting their wallet and have that data saved on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract.
To make this a little spicy, when someone waves at me there is a random chance they can win a small amount of ETH from my site :)  
✅ Deployed a custom Smart Contract.  
✅ Built a "Connect Wallet" flow.  
✅ Designed the UI from scratch using Figma.  
✅ Created my own version of web3 Twitter.  

# Sample Hardhat Project
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
