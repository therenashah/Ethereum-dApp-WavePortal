# Ethereum-dApp-WavePortal
A website that let's anyone wave at me after connecting their wallet and have that data saved on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract. 
To make this a little spicy as well, when someone waves at  there is a random chance they can win a small amount of ETH from my site :)
✅ Deployed a custom smart contract.
✅ Built a "Connect Wallet" flow.
✅ Created my own version of Web3 Twitter.
✅ Designed UI from scratch using Figma.
